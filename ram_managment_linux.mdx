# Clean Up Your RAM & Swap on Ubuntu/Pop!_OS: A Step-by-Step Guide

If you’re finding your Ubuntu or Pop!_OS system dragging, sometimes clearing out RAM caches and swap can give you a little boost. In this guide, we’ll walk through both command-line and GUI methods to free up memory and swap space. Let’s break it down in plain terms.

---

## Command-Line Methods

### 1. Clear RAM Cache (Drop Caches)

Linux automatically caches data in RAM to speed things up. If you really need to clear it (not usually necessary), use this command:

```bash
sudo sh -c "sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
```

**What it does:**  
- `sync`: Flushes file system buffers.  
- `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`: Clears page cache, dentries, and inodes.

*Use it with caution—Linux is pretty good at managing memory on its own.*

### 2. Clear Swap Memory 

If your system is swapping too much, you can reset it by turning swap off and then back on:

```bash
sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a
```
-

**Explanation:**  
- `swapoff -a`: Disables all swap devices.  
- `swapon -a`: Re-enables them, clearing the swap in the process.
- Turning swap back-On is not guaranteed.
- A simple restart will fix the swap off issue.

### 3. Adjust Swappiness to Reduce Swap Usage

By default, Linux starts swapping at a swappiness value of 60. Lowering it means your system will prefer using RAM. For example, to set it to 10:

```bash
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
```

To make this permanent:

```bash
echo "vm.swappiness=10" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

### 4. Kill High-Memory Processes

Sometimes, the simplest fix is to kill a process that’s hogging memory. Use:

```bash
top
```

Press `M` to sort by memory usage, note the PID, and then kill it:

```bash
sudo kill -9 PID
```

Or, for a friendlier interface, install and use `htop`:

```bash
sudo apt install htop -y
htop
```

Navigate with your arrow keys and hit `F9` to kill the misbehaving process.

## GUI Methods

If you’re not a fan of the terminal, these GUI apps can help you manage memory and swap easily.

### 1. Stacer

Stacer is a system optimizer that lets you clean your memory with just one click.

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt install stacer -y
```

**Usage:**  
Open Stacer, go to the “System Cleaner” section, then select “Memory” to clear caches.

### 2. BleachBit

BleachBit isn’t just for cleaning up disk space—it can also free up memory.

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt install bleachbit -y
```

**Usage:**  
Launch BleachBit and use the “Free Memory” option to clear RAM.

### 3. Gnome System Monitor

This tool shows you real-time resource usage and lets you kill any process directly.

**Installation (if needed):**

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-system-monitor -y
```

**Usage:**  
Open Gnome System Monitor, check the Processes tab, and end any heavy processes.

---

### 4. LXTask

For a lighter option, LXTask provides a simple overview of running processes and memory usage.

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt install lxtask -y
```

**Usage:**  
Launch LXTask to spot and stop memory-heavy apps.

## Final Thoughts

There isn’t a one-size-fits-all fix. If you like quick command-line solutions, try clearing caches and adjusting swappiness. If you prefer a visual approach, tools like Stacer and BleachBit offer a straightforward way to keep your system lean.

Keeping your system in check is a continuous process—choose the method that fits your workflow best, and remember that sometimes Linux just needs a little nudge.

Hope this helps, boss! Let me know if you need any more tweaks or details.
