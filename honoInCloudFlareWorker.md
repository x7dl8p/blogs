# Build a Minimal CRUD Backend on Cloudflare Workers: Step-by-Step Guide

I was exploring free backend hosting options and ran into a common problem: many providers, like Railway, give you a one-time credit rather than a predictable monthly baseline. That makes it hard to plan for ongoing development and testing. I wanted something free, consistent, and modern. That's when I found **Cloudflare Workers**.

This guide will walk you through the essentials of setting up a minimal backend. By the end, you'll have a clear path to a lightweight, functional CRUD API.

## What is Cloudflare Workers?

Cloudflare Workers is a **serverless platform** that runs your code at Cloudflare's global data centers (their "edge"). Instead of a single server or virtual machine, your code executes close to the user, which improves speed and reduces latency.

Think of Workers as a globally distributed runtime for JavaScript, giving your APIs ultra-low latency without worrying about infrastructure.

### Key points:

* **No servers to manage:** Upload your code, and Cloudflare runs it.
* **Edge execution:** Code runs near users worldwide.
* **Fast and secure:** Uses a lightweight JavaScript environment (V8), not Node.js.

### Example: A "Hello World" Worker

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    return new Response("Hello World", { status: 200 });
  }
}
```

This example illustrates how simple it is to deploy a global endpoint. Users anywhere in the world will hit the nearest edge and get an instant response.

## Free Tier Limits

Cloudflare gives a clear free tier, more then enough for mid apps:

* 100,000 requests per day
* 1,000 requests per minute (burst)
* 10 ms CPU time per request
* 3,000 build minutes per month
* Up to 100 Worker scripts
* Key-value storage (KV): 100,000 reads/day, 1,000 writes/day, 1 GB storage

Static assets are free and unlimited.

Understanding the free limits upfront helps prevent surprises and lets you plan for realistic workloads. Most personal or mid-scale projects fit comfortably within these bounds.

## Choosing a Framework for CRUD Apps

For a simple CRUD backend, you want something **light and fast**:

This section compares two popular frameworks suitable for Workers, focusing on footprint, structure, and flexibility.

### 1. Hono

* Express-like API, small (\~22 KB), TypeScript-friendly
* Good for relational data or if you want some middleware
* Example:

```javascript
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('/items', c => c.json([{ id: 1, name: 'item1' }]))
app.post('/items', async c => {
  const body = await c.req.json()
  return c.json({ id: Date.now(), ...body })
})

export default app
```

Hono is ideal, mainly for supporting dependent db if you want structure and type safety while keeping the code minimal, It balances simplicity with the ability to grow.

### 2. itty-router

* Minimal (\~1 KB), just routes and CRUD
* Use if you want a tiny footprint
* Example:

```javascript
import { Router } from 'itty-router'

const router = Router()

router.get('/items', () => new Response(JSON.stringify([{ id: 1 }])) )
router.post('/items', async (req) => {
  const body = await req.json()
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ id: Date.now(), ...body }))
})

export default { fetch: router.handle }
```

itty-router is perfect for extremely minimal setups. but only lookup to a single table It does routing only and leaves you with only single table. (Does not support relational db)

### Recommendation

* **Hono:** best for structured, relational data
* **itty-router:** smallest possible CRUD backend, single table lookups

I would go with hono, always.

## How to Build a Simple Backend

Follow these steps to get a minimal backend running:

This section is a practical roadmap. You’ll see how to initialize a project, pick storage, and deploy quickly.

1. **Install Wrangler (Cloudflare CLI):**

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

2. **Create a new Worker project:**

```bash
wrangler generate my-backend
cd my-backend
```

3. **Pick a framework:** Hono for structured data, itty-router for tiny not relational CRUD.

4. **Define your endpoints:** `/items`, `/customers`, `/sales`, etc.

5. **Use KV or D1 for storage:**

   * KV: fast key-value storage, ideal for cached or small JSON objects.
   * D1: SQLite-style relational DB at the edge, good for structured data.

6. **Deploy to Cloudflare:**

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

7. **Test your API:** Open the deployed endpoint in a browser or use Postman/cURL.

Breaking the process into small steps makes it manageable, even if you’ve never deployed to edge servers before.

## Example: Cooler Management Backend that i built.

Suppose you have entities like:

* **Cooler** (name, tank size, motor type, color)
* **Manufacturer** (name, address, phone, GST ID)
* **Purchase** (cooler ID, manufacturer ID, quantity, date, purchase price)
* **Customer** (name, phone, GST ID, Aadhaar)
* **Sale** (customer ID, cooler ID, quantity, date, actual sale price)

This is a relational dataset, so using Hono makes managing endpoints and types much easier.

Because this is relational data with relationships between entities, **Hono is the better choice**. It allows you to:

* Define structured endpoints for each entity (`/coolers`, `/manufacturers`, `/purchases`, `/customers`, `/sales`)
* Integrate with **D1** (Cloudflare's edge SQLite) or external databases
* Keep type safety with TypeScript interfaces
* Scale CRUD logic without sacrificing clarity or performance

Minimal Hono CRUD skeleton for Coolers:

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()

type Cooler = {
  id: string
  name: string
  tankSize: number
  motorType: string
  color: string
}

// Create a new cooler
app.post('/coolers', async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json<Cooler>()
  return c.json({ message: 'Cooler created', data: body }, 201)
})

// Get all coolers
app.get('/coolers', async (c) => {
  return c.json([{ id: '1', name: 'Symphony', tankSize: 40, motorType: 'BLDC', color: 'White' }])
})

export default app
```

This example shows how to start structured CRUD development on Cloudflare Workers. Even with relational data, you can remain minimal, fast, and type-safe.
