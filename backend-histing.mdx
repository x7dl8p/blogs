When working with frontend platforms like **Netlify** or **Vercel**, deploying backend services like **Express.js**, **NestJS**, or **Django** is not possible. These platforms support only stateless serverless functions or API routes and can&apos;t keep persistent backend servers running.

To host a full backend, here are three top services similar to Netlify — but made for backend logic and APIs:

---

## 1. Render

Render provides a Netlify-like developer experience for backend apps. It supports persistent services like Node.js, FastAPI, and more. Free tier gives 750 hours/month per service.

**Highlights:**
- Built-in PostgreSQL
- Free SSL and custom domain
- Auto-deploy from GitHub
- Background workers and cron jobs supported
- Sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity in free tier
- Cold start latency of 1–3 seconds
- No Docker required, but supported

Render is the closest to Netlify in feel but tailored for full-stack apps.

## 2. Railway

Railway is developer-friendly and great for fast backend deployments. It supports monorepos, databases, and background workers. However, it gives a **one-time $5 free credit only**, not monthly.

**Highlights:**
- Built-in database provisioning
- GitHub deploy + CLI
- Shared CPU and 512MB RAM during trial
- Great DX, fast deployment
- Auto-sleeps when on trial unless upgraded
- Paid Hobby plan is $5/month (includes $5 usage), resets monthly with no carryover
- No persistent volumes in free plan

Railway is ideal for quick MVPs or small APIs if you&apos;re okay with paying after the trial.

## 3. Fly.io

Fly.io is a globally distributed platform that runs Dockerized apps close to your users. It includes a recurring **$5/month free credit**, making it a strong contender.

**Highlights:**
- 3 shared vCPUs and 256MB–512MB RAM in free plan
- Supports Docker, buildpacks, and Fly Machines
- 3GB persistent volume in free tier
- Low latency via edge deployments
- Runs background workers with Fly Machines
- No forced sleeping when configured properly
- GitHub deploy or Fly CLI

Fly.io is great for globally available backends and scalable deployments.

## Hosting a NestJS eCommerce App? Here&apos;s the Breakdown

For a NestJS backend with real-world needs like database, background jobs, and no sleep:

- **Use Render** if you want the best free experience with PostgreSQL, cron jobs, and easy Git deploys.
- **Use Fly.io** if you need edge deployment, speed, and recurring monthly credit.
- **Skip Railway** unless you&apos;re okay with paying $5/month after the one-time trial.

---

## Summary of Key Differences

- **Free monthly credit**:  
  - Render and Fly.io offer recurring free usage.  
  - Railway offers only a one-time $5 credit.

- **Database support**:  
  - Render and Railway provide built-in databases.  
  - Fly.io connects to external DB or volumes.

- **Persistent storage**:  
  - Fly.io offers 3GB volume.  
  - Render supports volumes on paid tiers.  
  - Railway lacks persistent storage in free/cheap tiers.

- **Sleep behavior**:  
  - Render and Railway auto-sleep in free/trial plans.  
  - Fly.io does not force sleep if configured with Machines.

- **Background jobs**:  
  - Render has built-in support.  
  - Fly.io supports them via Fly Machines.  
  - Railway requires manual setup.

---

## Final Recommendation

If you&apos;re building a production-grade NestJS app:

- Start with **Render** for full backend flexibility and low cost.
- Migrate to **Fly.io** when you need edge performance or fine-tuned scaling.
- Use **Railway** only if you want the best developer interface and don&apos;t mind a small monthly fee after the trial.
